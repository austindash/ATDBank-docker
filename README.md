# ATDBank-austin_dash_fullStackBankingApplication
May 24, 2022
This project is my capstone for the MIT Full-Stack Certificate in Coding course.
It mocks the functionality of a bank application and uses a 3 tier build.
These files include the front end application written in js, and a middleware server created with express that can connect to and use any mongo database.
In the future I plan to implement a firebase login, as the login is currently incomplete.
