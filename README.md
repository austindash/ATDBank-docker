# ATDBank-austin_dash_fullStackBankingApplication

This project was my capstone for the MIT Full-Stack certificate in coding course.
It mocks the fucctionality of a bank application and uses a 3 tier build.
These files include the front end application written in js, and a middleware server created with express that can connect to and use any mongo database.
In the future I plan to implement a firebase login, as the login is currently incomplete.
